const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisofrequirements = "This is the step where you will determine what will be required in preparation for creating the product, manpower, systems, software, etc."
const design = "This phase of the SDLC starts by turning the software specifications into a design plan."
const implementation = "This is where the developer gets the design and will start to code, actually creating the product."
const testingandintegration = "This is where the code is complete and the product/modules are released for testing. It is tested thoroughly and will report any problems as to give the customer the best product possible."
